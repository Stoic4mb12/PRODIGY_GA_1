# PRODIGY_Trackcode_1
I created a simple chatbot using the GPT-2 model with the Hugging Face Transformers library and PyTorch, all in Python. The process starts by installing and importing the necessary libraries.I then load a pre-trained GPT-2 model and its tokenizer to process and understand input text. The code checks if a GPU is available to make computations faster and moves the model to either the CPU or GPU accordingly. To generate responses, a function takes user input, tokenizes it, and uses the GPT-2 model to generate a reply, which is then converted back into readable text. This Python setup allows the chatbot to have coherent and contextually relevant conversations with users.
